## 🤖 Machine Learning Component

The `ml_model/` folder contains:

- Preprocessing scripts  
- A trained model saved using `joblib`  
- Logic for loading the model and predicting performance categories  

The ML model predicts one of the following categories:

- **Excellent**  
- **Good**  
- **Average**  
- **Poor**

These predictions are based on student academic and behavioral input features.

## 📤 Export Feature

Teachers can export student performance reports in **CSV** format for offline analysis and documentation.
